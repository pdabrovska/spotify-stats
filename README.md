## About The StatsSpotify:
It is a responsive web app, which allows the user to check their Spotify wrapped and share/download the result. Made with Spotify API.
StatsSpotify has the section which showcase the analysis of Spotify user behavior and most streamed songs in 2023 (based on Kaggle datasets). The dashboards were created in Power BI

This website is still in development, because of Spotify Policy if you want to login you have to be added manually as the user by me.
